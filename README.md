Abstract 

The indirect contribution of multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses to disability worsening outcomes, and vice-versa, remains unclear. Disease modifying therapies (DMTs) are potential modulators of this association. Understanding how these endo-phenotypes interact may provide insights into disease pathogenesis and treatment practice in relapse-onset MS (ROMS). Utilising a unique, prospectively collected clinical data from a longitudinal cohort of 279 first demyelinating event cases followed for up to 15 years post-onset, we examined indirect associations between relapses and treatment and the risk of disability worsening, and vice-versa. Indirect association parameters were estimated using joint models for longitudinal and survival data.
